Budget Chinese-manufactured machines (typically $2,000-$5,000 from Alibaba) cram all four wavelengths into a single handpiece firing simultaneously. The 940nm addition over tri-wavelength machines is a spec-sheet differentiator to stand out in a crowded market of cheap imports (the clinical benefit over a quality tri-wavelength system is negligible). Premium systems like the Sciton OMNI also offer four wavelengths (760nm, 810nm, 940nm, 1060nm), but as separate dedicated handpieces that clinicians select based on patient skin type and treatment area. That is wavelength selection, not wavelength stacking, a fundamentally different and clinically meaningful approach. The critical issue is never the number of wavelengths. It is the quality of engineering behind them. A $3,000 quad-wavelength machine from Alibaba has four wavelengths on paper, but the power output per wavelength, pulse control precision, beam uniformity, and cooling system quality are not comparable to a premium system. When a clinic advertises '4-wavelength laser', ask what brand and model they are using and whether the wavelengths are in separate handpieces or a single combined handpiece. If it is not from a recognized manufacturer, the extra wavelength is a marketing talking point, not a clinical advantage.",
