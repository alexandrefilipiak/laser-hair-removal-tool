<objective>
Extend equipment data and machine pages with 300+ words of unique SEO content per machine, and verify existing technology term and skin type implementations satisfy requirements.

Purpose: SEO-05 requires each machine page to have substantial unique content, not just templated specs. Additionally, this plan verifies that technology term searchability (SRCH-05), technology term pages (SEO-06, CLAS-08), and skin type informational display (CLAS-05, CLAS-06) are working correctly.

Output:
- Extended RichContent type in equipment.ts
- All machine entries in equipment.json have richContent field
- EquipmentDetails component renders rich content sections
- Verification that technology terms and skin types satisfy requirements
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Extend equipment types with RichContent interface</name>
  <files>src/lib/equipment.ts</files>
  <action>
Add RichContent interface to equipment.ts with four fields:
- overview: string (2-3 sentence general overview)
- howItWorks: string (technical explanation of device operation)
- typicalUses: string (common clinical applications)
- keyFeatures: string (distinguishing characteristics)

Extend MachineEntry interface to include:
- richContent: RichContent | null (optional for backwards compatibility)

Place RichContent interface after SkinTypeInfo and before MachineEntry.
Do NOT modify any existing types - only add new interface and extend MachineEntry.
  </action>
  <verify>
TypeScript compiles without errors: npx tsc --noEmit
  </verify>
  <done>RichContent interface exists and MachineEntry includes richContent field</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Populate richContent for all machine entries</name>
  <files>src/data/equipment.json</files>
  <action>
Add richContent field to ALL machine entries (type: "machine") in equipment.json.

Content requirements per machine:
- overview: 2-3 sentences describing what the machine is
- howItWorks: 3-4 sentences on the technical operation (wavelength, energy delivery, cooling)
- typicalUses: 2-3 sentences on common treatment areas and hair types
- keyFeatures: 2-3 sentences on distinguishing characteristics

CRITICAL: Each machine content must be UNIQUE. Do not use templated boilerplate.
- GentleMax Pro content should differ from GentleLase content
- Reference actual specs (wavelengths, cooling method) in the content
- Total word count per machine should exceed 100 words minimum (combined with existing notes field = 300+ words on page)

For technology terms (type: "technology-term"), do NOT add richContent - they already have whatItIs and whyItMatters fields.

Content accuracy guidelines:
- Focus on factual technical specifications
- Use informational language ("commonly used for", "designed for")
- Avoid medical advice ("safe for", "recommended for", "will work on")
- Reference manufacturer-published specs where possible
  </action>
  <verify>
1. JSON is valid: node -e "require('./src/data/equipment.json')"

2. All machines have richContent: node -e "const d=require('./src/data/equipment.json'); const machines=d.filter(e=>e.type==='machine'); const missing=machines.filter(m=>!m.richContent); console.log('Missing richContent:', missing.length, missing.map(m=>m.slug))"

3. TypeScript compiles: npx tsc --noEmit

4. Content uniqueness check - compare richContent.overview for 3 different machines:
node -e "const d=require('./src/data/equipment.json'); const samples=['gentlemax-pro','gentlelase','soprano-ice-platinum']; samples.forEach(s=>{const m=d.find(e=>e.slug===s); console.log('---',s,'---'); console.log(m.richContent?.overview?.substring(0,100)+'...')})"
Verify: The overview text differs meaningfully across machines - NOT templated with just name substitution.
  </verify>
  <done>All machine entries have richContent with unique, factual content</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Extend EquipmentDetails to display rich content</name>
  <files>src/components/EquipmentDetails.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add rich content sections to EquipmentDetails component, rendered below the notes section and above the Disclaimer.

Add conditional rendering for richContent with sections: Overview, How It Works, Typical Uses, Key Features.

Styling notes:
- Use consistent heading style (text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800)
- Paragraphs use text-gray-700 leading-relaxed for readability
- mt-6 spacing between sections
- Place AFTER notes section, BEFORE Disclaimer

Do NOT add 'use client' - keep as Server Component.

1. Build succeeds: npm run build

2. Dev server shows rich content:
npm run dev
Visit http://localhost:3000/is-it-a-real-laser/gentlemax-pro
Verify Overview, How It Works, Typical Uses, Key Features sections appear
  </verify>
  <done>Machine pages display rich content sections with 300+ total words</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Verify existing technology term and skin type implementations</name>
  <files>N/A - verification only</files>
  <action>
This task verifies that existing implementations satisfy requirements. NO code changes needed.

Verify SRCH-05 (Technology terms searchable):
- Confirm useSearch.ts searches all EquipmentEntry[] (includes technology terms)
- Technology terms have name, aliases, slug fields that Fuse.js searches

Verify SEO-06 (Technology term pages exist):
- Confirm [slug]/page.tsx uses generateStaticParams() which includes technology term slugs
- Confirm build generates pages at /is-it-a-real-laser/shr, /is-it-a-real-laser/bbl, etc.

Verify CLAS-08 (Technology term clarification display):
- Confirm TechnologyTermDetails.tsx displays whatItIs and whyItMatters fields
- These are the clarification fields explaining what the term means

Verify CLAS-05, CLAS-06 (Skin type informational content):
- Confirm EquipmentDetails.tsx displays skinTypes.displayText
- Confirm the text is purely informational (e.g., "All skin tones (dual wavelength system)")
- Confirm NO safety recommendations (no "safe for", "recommended for" language)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Technology term searchability (manual test on /is-it-a-real-laser):
Type "SHR" in search - should show "SHR (Super Hair Removal)" in results
Type "BBL" - should show "BBL (BroadBand Light)"
Type "diode" - should show "810nm Diode"

2. Technology term pages exist (check build output):
npm run build - verify output includes routes for /is-it-a-real-laser/shr, /is-it-a-real-laser/bbl, /is-it-a-real-laser/755nm

3. Technology term clarification display:
npm run dev - Visit http://localhost:3000/is-it-a-real-laser/shr
Verify "What It Is" section displays whatItIs content
Verify "Why It Matters" section displays whyItMatters content

4. Skin type informational content:
Visit http://localhost:3000/is-it-a-real-laser/gentlemax-pro
Verify "Skin Types" card displays "All skin tones (dual wavelength system)"
Confirm no safety language like "safe for" or "recommended for"

5. Code inspection (already verified during planning):
TechnologyTermDetails.tsx lines 64-79: displays whatItIs and whyItMatters
EquipmentDetails.tsx lines 108-114: displays skinTypes.displayText
useSearch.ts: searches EquipmentEntry[] which includes technology terms
[slug]/page.tsx: handles both machines and technology terms
  </verify>
  <done>Existing implementations verified: technology terms are searchable, have pages with clarification, and skin types display informational content only</done>
</task>

</tasks>
