<objective>
Populate the complete equipment database with all ~38 Phase 1 entries including clinical lasers, home lasers, technology terms, wavelength entries, and multi-purpose platforms.

Purpose: This is the core data asset that powers the entire tool. Without complete, accurate classification data, the tool has no value.

Output: Fully populated equipment.json with all entries properly classified.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Technology Terms & Wavelength Entries (~10 entries)</name>
  <files>src/data/equipment.json</files>
  <action>
    Add technology term and wavelength entries. Each must follow TechnologyTermEntry type exactly.

    **Delivery Method Terms:**
    - SHR (Super Hair Removal)
      - technologyType: "delivery-method"
      - isRealLaser: null (depends on underlying device)
      - whatItIs: "SHR stands for Super Hair Removal. It's a delivery method, not a type of light source."
      - whyItMatters: Detailed explanation that SHR can be delivered by laser OR IPL - the term alone doesn't tell you if it's a real laser. Need to ask what device powers the SHR.
      - askYourClinic: "What is the brand and model of the device delivering SHR?"

    **Technology Classification Terms:**
    - AFT (Advanced Fluorescence Technology)
      - technologyType: "ipl"
      - isRealLaser: false
      - whatItIs: Brief explanation it's Alma's branded IPL technology
      - whyItMatters: Not a laser, but a form of IPL

    - BBL (BroadBand Light)
      - technologyType: "ipl"
      - isRealLaser: false
      - whatItIs: Sciton's branded IPL system
      - whyItMatters: Premium IPL but still not a laser

    - E-Light
      - technologyType: "ipl"
      - isRealLaser: false
      - whatItIs: Combined IPL + RF technology
      - whyItMatters: Marketing term, not a laser

    - OPT (Optimal Pulse Technology)
      - technologyType: "ipl"
      - isRealLaser: false
      - whatItIs: IPL pulse delivery method
      - whyItMatters: Still IPL, not laser

    - DPL (Dynamic Pulse Light)
      - technologyType: "ipl"
      - isRealLaser: false
      - whatItIs: Another IPL variant
      - whyItMatters: Marketing name for IPL

    **Wavelength Entries:**
    - 755nm (Alexandrite)
      - technologyType: "wavelength"
      - isRealLaser: true (when used in laser systems)
      - whatItIs: "755nm is the wavelength of Alexandrite lasers, one of the most effective for hair removal."
      - whyItMatters: Brief - this wavelength in laser form is gold standard

    - 808nm / 810nm (Diode)
      - slug: "810nm" (with alias "808nm")
      - technologyType: "wavelength"
      - isRealLaser: null (critical entry!)
      - whatItIs: "810nm (or 808nm) is the diode laser wavelength."
      - whyItMatters: DETAILED - This is the critical consumer confusion point. A $3,000 Alibaba machine uses the same 810nm wavelength as a $100,000 LightSheer. The wavelength alone doesn't determine quality - it's the power, spot size, cooling, and engineering that matter. Ask about the specific device brand and model.
      - askYourClinic: "What brand and model of 810nm diode laser do you use?"

    - 1064nm (Nd:YAG)
      - technologyType: "wavelength"
      - isRealLaser: true
      - whatItIs: "1064nm is the Nd:YAG laser wavelength, effective for darker skin tones."
      - whyItMatters: Safe for Fitzpatrick V-VI, penetrates deeper

    - Dual Wavelength (755+1064nm)
      - slug: "dual-wavelength"
      - technologyType: "wavelength"
      - isRealLaser: true
      - whatItIs: "Dual wavelength systems combine 755nm Alexandrite and 1064nm Nd:YAG."
      - whyItMatters: Versatile for multiple skin types

    For EACH entry include:
    - type: "technology-term"
    - slug: lowercase (e.g., "shr", "755nm")
    - name: display name (e.g., "SHR (Super Hair Removal)", "755nm Alexandrite")
    - technologyType: appropriate value
    - isRealLaser: boolean or null
    - whatItIs: 1-2 sentence explanation
    - whyItMatters: variable length matching confusion level
    - askYourClinic: guidance or null
    - aliases: lowercase variations
  </action>
  <verify>
    - TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
    - All entries have type: "technology-term"

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Home Lasers & Final Validation</name>
  <files>src/data/equipment.json</files>
  <action>
    Add home laser entries and run final validation.

    **Home Lasers (consumer tier):**
    - Tria 4X (Tria Beauty)
      - type: "machine"
      - technologyType: "laser" (it IS a real diode laser)
      - brandTier: "consumer"
      - wavelengths: ["810nm"]
      - notes: "Home-use diode laser. Significantly lower power than clinical devices (20J vs 100J+). FDA-cleared for home use. Results require more sessions than clinical treatment."
      - purposeBuilt: true
      - skinTypes: { fitzpatrickRange: "I-IV", displayText: "Designed for light to medium skin tones. Not safe for darker skin." }

    - Tria Precision (Tria Beauty)
      - Similar to Tria 4X but smaller spot size
      - notes: "Compact home-use laser for smaller areas. Same technology as Tria 4X with smaller treatment area."

    **Final Validation:**
    1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` - must compile clean
    2. Run `npm test` - all equipment tests must pass
    3. Count total entries - should be ~38 (25 machines + 10 tech terms + 2 home + 1 buffer)
    4. Verify brand tier distribution:
       - premium-clinical: ~12 entries (Candela, Cynosure, Lumenis)
       - standard-clinical: ~8 entries (Alma, InMode, Lutronic)
       - consumer: 2 entries (Tria)
       - unknown: 0 entries (will be used for unverified brands found later)
    5. Verify all aliases are lowercase
    6. Verify slug uniqueness (no duplicates including aliases)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - `npm test` passes (all equipment tests)
    - Manual count of entries in JSON ~38
    - JSON is valid (no syntax errors)
  </verify>
  <done>
    Complete equipment database with ~38 entries, all type-safe, all tests passing, brand tiers correctly assigned.
  </done>

1. TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. All tests pass: `npm test`
3. Entry count: `node -e "console.log(require('./src/data/equipment.json').length)"` returns ~38
4. Type distribution: count entries by type field
5. Brand tier distribution: count machine entries by brandTier field
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Equipment JSON contains ~38 entries total
- All entries pass TypeScript type checking
- All utility function tests pass
- Brand tiers correctly classify: premium (Candela/Cynosure/Lumenis), standard (Alma/InMode/Lutronic), consumer (Tria)
- Technology terms have appropriate clarification depth
- 808nm entry explains the $3,000 vs $100,000 problem
- SHR entry clarifies it's a delivery method, not a laser type
- Home laser entries clearly note lower power vs clinical
