## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts / authentication | Not needed for lookup tool |
| User reviews or ratings | Creates moderation burden, potential legal issues |
| Medical advice or safety recommendations | Liability exposure, informational only |
| Real-time clinic equipment verification | Manual database only for v1 |
| Price information | Varies too much, creates maintenance burden |
| Clinic booking or scheduling | Directory feature, not tool |
| Multi-language support | English only for v1 |
| API access | Build for web first |
