# Laser Equipment Checker Tool

## 1. Executive Summary

A searchable database that lets consumers verify if a clinic's equipment is a "real laser" or IPL/BBL. No such tool exists in the market — RealSelf has fragmented Q&A, FDA has a technical database, but nobody offers a simple consumer-facing lookup.

**URL:** `laserhairremovalmap.com/is-it-a-real-laser`

**Purpose:** Backlink magnet that builds domain authority for LaserHairRemovalMap.com while providing genuine consumer value.

## 2. Market Gap Validation

### 2.1 Competitive Research (February 2026)

| Resource | What It Does | Gap |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| FDA Medical Device Database | Technical registry of cleared devices | Not consumer-friendly, doesn't classify laser vs IPL |
| RealSelf Q&A | Doctors answer "Which machine is best?" | Fragmented across hundreds of posts, no searchable database |
| Blog articles | "IPL vs Laser" explainers | Generic education, can't look up specific machines |
| Review sites (Good Housekeeping, Women's Health) | Test at-home devices | Focus on consumer devices, not professional equipment |
| Manufacturer sites (Candela, Cynosure) | Product specs | Only their own products, marketing language |

**Conclusion:** Nobody offers a single searchable database where consumers can type a machine name and get a clear classification.

### 2.2 The Supply Side Problem: $3,000 vs $100,000 Machines

A Reddit post reveals the supply side of the problem the directory solves — someone literally asking "what cheap machine should I buy to start a hair removal business."

**Budget "starter" equipment:**

| Machine | Price | What it really is |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| IPL SHR combo | $2,800-3,800 | Cheap Chinese multi-function IPL |
| 808nm diode | $4,000-6,000 | Budget diode laser |
| Nd:YAG | $6,000+ | Entry level Nd:YAG |

**Professional equipment:**

| Machine | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Candela GentleMax Pro | $80,000-150,000 |
| Soprano Titanium | $100,000-165,000 |
| LightSheer Duet | $60,000-100,000 |

Someone can start a "laser hair removal business" with a $2,800 Chinese IPL machine that also does tattoo removal, acne treatment, and RF skin tightening. Meanwhile, a Reddit AMA tech spent $165,000 on a Soprano and STILL sold it because results weren't good enough.

This is exactly the "dirty trick" the 20-year tech warned about. Clinics buy one cheap multi-purpose machine to maximize ROI. It does everything, excels at nothing.

**Layer 2 validation:**

| Layer 2 check | $3,000 machine | $100,000 machine |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Purpose-built for hair removal? | ❌ "Also does acne, RF, tattoo removal" | ✅ Dedicated hair removal |
| Professional grade? | ❌ Alibaba special | ✅ FDA-cleared clinical device |
| Effective? | ⚠️ Will remove some hair | ✅ Gold standard results |

### 2.3 Practitioner Validation: The Clinic Owner's Checklist

**Source:** Premier Laser Clinic, experienced practitioner (2008–present)

A practitioner from a premium clinic listed every differentiator the directory could verify:

> "Always be careful if a clinic is offering low cost hair removal. Price is not the best way to choose which clinic to use. It is usually cheaper for a reason."

**Their checklist vs directory features:**

| Their concern | Directory feature |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "Low quality machines from Alibaba vs $100k Candela" | ✅ Equipment verification — exactly what we built |
| "Are staff trained?" | Credential tier (dermatologist / NP / licensed LHP / aesthetician) |
| "Are they experienced?" | Years in practice, review count |
| "Do they do laser as side revenue?" | Layer 2 — purpose-built vs multi-purpose machine |
| "Do they maintain equipment?" | Could add "year of equipment purchase" to claimed listings |
| "Are they insured?" | Could be a claimed listing checkbox |
| "Cleanliness" | The hygiene angle from the Reddit AMA — contact cooling vs cryogen |
| "Medical emergency preparedness" | Provider credential tier signals this |

**Why this matters:** This isn't a consumer complaining. It's a practitioner from a premium clinic frustrated that cheap operators undercut them on price while delivering worse service. This person WANTS the directory to exist because it would validate their $100k investment and expose the $3k Alibaba competitors.

This is the ideal early adopter clinic profile: Premium equipment, frustrated by cheap competition, motivated to differentiate.

### 2.4 Content Angle: The $3,000 vs $100,000 Story

A blog post like "The $3,000 Machine vs the $100,000 Machine: What's Really Removing Your Hair?" would be powerful. No naming specific clinics — just educating consumers that:

1. You can buy a hair removal machine on Alibaba for $2,800
2. It comes with 3 handles that do 5 different treatments
3. Meanwhile the gold standard Candela costs $100,000+
4. Your clinic might be using either one
5. You have no way of knowing unless someone verifies it
6. **That's what our directory does**

The Alibaba angle keeps getting stronger — two independent sources confirming the same $3,000 Alibaba vs $100,000 Candela gap. Screenshots of $2,800 "professional laser hair removal machines" from Alibaba would make devastating visual content.

**Checklist framework for homepage:**

> "Before choosing a laser clinic, ask:"
> - What machine do they use? ($3,000 import or $100,000 clinical grade?)
> - Is it purpose-built for hair removal?
> - Are providers trained and credentialed?
> - Is a physician supervising?
>
> "Or let us check for you →"

### 2.5 Reddit Insight: Even Dermatologists Use IPL

**Source:** [r/HairRemoval thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairRemoval/comments/1ppxp2v/is_professional_laser_hair_removal_actually/)

> "The only dermatologist here offers forever bare BBL which I think is just clinical IPL."

Sciton Forever Bare BBL is broadband light — it's IPL, not a laser. Even the most credentialed provider type (dermatologist) isn't immune to using IPL and marketing it as hair removal.

This proves equipment verification matters at every level:
- Cheap med spas using IPL → expected
- Dermatologists using IPL → surprising to consumers
- Both marketing it as "hair removal" without distinguishing from laser → the problem we solve

## 3. Three-Layer Classification System

### 3.1 The "Dirty Secret" Insight

A 20-year veteran laser technician revealed on Reddit that clinics buy one multi-purpose machine to maximize ROI. They can do skin rejuvenation, vascular treatments, pigmentation AND hair removal with one device. But a machine built to do everything does none of them as well as a dedicated machine.

### 3.2 Classification Layers

**Layer 1: Is it a real laser?**
- ✅ Real Laser
- ❌ Not a Laser (IPL/BBL/AFT)

**Layer 2: Is it designed for hair removal?**
- ✅ Purpose-built for hair removal
- ⚠️ Multi-purpose device (hair removal is one of many functions)
- ❌ Not designed for hair removal

**Layer 3: How effective is it for hair removal?**
- 🥇 Gold standard (Candela Alexandrite/Nd:YAG)
- ✅ Effective (dedicated diode lasers like LightSheer, DiolazeXL)
- ⚠️ Adequate but not optimal (multi-purpose platforms)

### 3.3 Evolved Classification: Three Layers of Trust

The classification evolves into three layers of trust:

**Layer 1: Is it a real laser?**
- ❌ IPL / BBL / AFT → Not a laser
- ✅ Real laser → proceed to Layer 2

**Layer 2: Is it a reputable brand?**
- ❌ Unbranded / Chinese import / Alibaba machine → Real laser but unknown quality
- ✅ Established manufacturer → proceed to Layer 3

**Layer 3: Is it purpose-built and clinical grade?**
- ⚠️ Multi-purpose platform → Adequate
- ✅ Dedicated hair removal → Gold standard

### 3.4 Brand Tier Classification

| Tier | Brands | Price range | Signal |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 🥇 Gold standard | Candela (GentleMax, GentleLase), Cynosure (Elite+), Lumenis (LightSheer) | $60,000-150,000 | Top US/Israeli manufacturers, decades of clinical data, FDA cleared |
| ✅ Established | Alma (Soprano), InMode (DiolazeXL), Lutronic (Clarity II), Sciton (laser models) | $40,000-120,000 | Reputable manufacturers, FDA cleared, widely used |
| ⚠️ Unknown | No brand mentioned, unrecognizable brand name, "808nm diode" with no manufacturer | $3,000-15,000 | Could be Alibaba import, no clinical data, unknown safety record |

**How this shows in the tool:**

Someone types "GentleMax Pro":
- ✅ Real Laser
- 🥇 Gold standard manufacturer (Candela)
- ✅ Purpose-built for hair removal
- Wavelength: 755nm + 1064nm

Someone types "808nm diode laser":
- ✅ Technically a real laser
- ⚠️ No recognizable manufacturer — ask your clinic what brand
- ⚠️ Common specification on unbranded import machines

That second result is powerful. We're not saying it's bad — we're saying "we can't verify the quality because there's no brand to verify." The consumer then asks their clinic "what brand is your machine?" If the clinic can't answer or gives a name nobody recognizes, the consumer draws their own conclusion.

**Legal protection:** We're not saying "this machine is dangerous." We're saying "this is an established, verifiable brand" vs "we have no data on this manufacturer." Factual, neutral, devastating.

### 3.5 Clinic Verification Badge Tiers

| Badge | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 🥇 Verified Gold Standard Laser | Candela, Cynosure, Lumenis — purpose-built |
| ✅ Verified Laser Technology | Established brand, real laser, FDA cleared |
| ⚠️ Unverified Equipment | Clinic hasn't specified or uses unknown brand |

**Badge adoption driver:** Clinics with Candela machines will WANT that gold badge. It justifies their $100k investment and differentiates them from the Alibaba clinic down the street. Premium clinics adopting the gold badge forces mid-tier clinics to claim their listings just to compete.

---

## 4. Layer 4: Skin Type Information

### 4.1 Wavelength and Skin Type Relationship

| Technology | Wavelength | Fitzpatrick I-III (light) | Fitzpatrick IV-V (medium-dark) | Fitzpatrick VI (very dark) |
|------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Alexandrite | 755nm | Commonly used | Higher risk profile | Generally not used |
| Diode | 810nm | Commonly used | Commonly used | Use with caution |
| Nd:YAG | 1064nm | Effective, may need more sessions | Commonly used | Preferred option |
| Dual (e.g. Clarity II) | 755 + 1064nm | Alexandrite mode typical | Nd:YAG mode typical | Nd:YAG mode only |
| IPL | Broad spectrum | Variable results | Higher risk profile | Generally not recommended |

### 4.2 Critical Safety Decision: Informational, Not Advisory

**The liability problem:** If the tool says "✅ Safe for your skin type" and it's wrong, someone could get burned. That's liability we don't want.

**Solution:** Remove the recommendation, keep the information. Don't tell people what's safe for them. Tell them what the machine does and let them discuss with their provider.

| Layer | Shows | Does NOT Show |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Layer 1 | "This is a real laser" / "This is IPL" | — |
| Layer 2 | "Purpose-built for hair removal" / "Multi-purpose" | — |
| Layer 3 | "Gold standard" / "Effective" / "Adequate" | — |
| Layer 4 | "Wavelength: 755nm. Commonly used for lighter skin tones." | "Safe for you" / "Not safe for you" |

### 4.3 Display Language

**Instead of:** "⚠️ This laser is not recommended for your skin type"

**Show:** "This laser operates at 755nm (Alexandrite). Generally used for Fitzpatrick skin types I-III. Discuss with your provider whether this is appropriate for your skin."

### 4.4 Permanent Disclaimer

Display on every result:

> "This tool provides general information about laser equipment. It is not medical advice. Always consult with a qualified provider to determine the best treatment for your skin type."

### 4.5 Why This Still Works

The tool educates without prescribing. The consumer learns enough to ask the right questions at their consultation. The tool helped them — but the medical decision stays with the provider.

Benefits retained:
- All SEO and backlink benefits
- Addresses the skin type concern
- Builds trust through transparency
- No liability exposure from bugs or incorrect data

### 4.6 SEO Keywords Unlocked

| Keyword | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| "best laser for dark skin" | High intent, safety-conscious |
| "laser hair removal dark skin safe" | Fear-based research |
| "can I get laser hair removal with dark skin" | Pre-purchase anxiety |
| "alexandrite laser dark skin" | Technology + skin type |
| "Nd:YAG vs alexandrite for brown skin" | Comparison shopping |

These are high-intent, high-anxiety queries from people who've heard horror stories about burns on dark skin. The tool addresses their concern with facts, not recommendations.

### 4.7 The Diversity Angle

Most laser directories and clinic websites show only light-skinned models. This tool explicitly addresses skin type information — that's inclusive, responsible, and fills a genuine information gap.

| Splendor X | Lumenis | Alexandrite + Nd:YAG | 755nm + 1064nm | ✅ Effective | All tones (dual modes) |

*Motus AX uses Moveo technology claiming safer profile for darker skin than traditional Alexandrite — discuss with provider.

### 5.2 Multi-Purpose Platforms (⚠️ Flagged)

| Machine | Manufacturer | Technology | Hair Removal? | Skin Type Info |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Harmony XL Pro | Alma | Laser + IPL platform | ⚠️ One of many functions | Varies by applicator |
| Nordlys | Candela | IPL + Nd:YAG platform | ⚠️ One of many functions | Nd:YAG mode for darker skin |
| Icon | Cynosure | IPL + laser platform | ⚠️ One of many functions | Varies by applicator |
| Stellar M22 | Lumenis | IPL + laser platform | ⚠️ One of many functions | Varies by applicator |

### 5.3 Home Laser Devices (⚠️ Real Laser, Lower Power)

| Machine | Manufacturer | Technology | Wavelength | Power | Classification |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|----------------|
| Tria 4X | Tria Beauty | Diode laser | 810nm | 20 J/cm² | ✅ Real laser, home power |
| Tria Precision | Tria Beauty | Diode laser | 810nm | 20 J/cm² | ✅ Real laser, home power |

**Note:** These are the ONLY true home laser devices. All other "laser" home devices are actually IPL.

### 5.4 Not Real Lasers — Professional IPL (❌ Excluded)

| Machine | Manufacturer | Technology | Why Excluded | Skin Type Risk |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Forever Bare BBL | Sciton | Broadband Light (IPL) | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| BBL Hero | Sciton | Broadband Light (IPL) | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| AFT (any applicator) | Alma | Advanced Fluorescence Technology | Advanced IPL, still not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| SHR on IPL applicator | Various | Super Hair Removal mode on IPL | IPL delivery method, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| Lumecca | InMode | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| Venus Versa | Venus | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| M22 IPL applicator | Lumenis | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| Quantum | Lumenis | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| Aculight | Various | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| Epilight | Various | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |
| PhotoDerm | Various | IPL | IPL, not laser | Higher risk for darker skin |

### 5.5 Not Real Lasers — Consumer IPL (❌ Excluded)

| Brand | Models | Technology | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| Braun | Silk Expert Pro 5, IPL5347, BD5001/5008/5009 | IPL | FDA-cleared, skin tone sensor |
| Philips | Lumea 9000 series | IPL | Popular in EU |
| Silk'n | Flash&Go, SensEpil, Bellalite, Glide, Infinity | IPL | FDA-cleared |
| Remington/Shaser | iLight Pro, iLight Ultra, iLight Prestige series | IPL | FDA-cleared |
| SmoothSkin | Gold, Bare, Pure Fit | IPL | FDA-cleared |
| Ulike | Air 10, Air 3, Sapphire series | IPL | Ice cooling |
| Cosbeauty | Perfect Smooth | IPL | FDA-cleared |
| Iluminage/Syneron | Touch, Precise Touch, Elos Me | IPL + RF | Combination technology |
| Nood | Flasher Pro | IPL | Budget option |
| LumaRx | Pro, Mini | IPL | FDA-cleared |
| Budget brands | INNZA, ZAIRUZ, Ubroo, LYSMOSKI, FELOOW | IPL | Varying quality |

**Important:** Despite marketing, ALL consumer devices except Tria are IPL, not laser. Many use terms like "laser-grade" or "laser-like" which are misleading.

### 5.6 Home Lasers vs Clinical Lasers — Power Comparison

Tria 4X is a rare exception — it's an actual diode laser (not IPL) for home use. But there's a critical power difference:

| Device | Power | Class | Results |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| Clinical diode (LightSheer, Soprano) | 25-50+ J/cm² | Class IV (clinical) | Professional-grade permanent reduction |
| Tria 4X | Up to 20 J/cm² | Class 1 (home) | Slower, requires more sessions |
| Home IPL (Braun, Philips) | 4-6.5 J/cm² | Not a laser | Temporary reduction |

**Classification for the tool:**

| Machine | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Tria 4X | ✅ Real Laser (diode 810nm) | ✅ Purpose-built | ⚠️ Home-use power |
| Tria Precision | ✅ Real Laser (diode 810nm) | ✅ Purpose-built | ⚠️ Home-use power |

**This creates a useful three-tier classification:**
- ✅ **Clinical laser** — professional grade, Class IV
- ⚠️ **Home laser** — real laser but lower power (Tria only)
- ❌ **Not a laser** — IPL/BBL/AFT

**Display for Tria 4X:**
> "This is a real diode laser (810nm) — one of the only true lasers available for home use. However, it operates at lower power (20 J/cm²) compared to clinical lasers (25-50+ J/cm²), meaning slower results requiring more sessions. For faster, more permanent results, find a clinic near you using a clinical-grade laser →"

This honest answer builds trust while still driving users to the directory.

### 5.7 Technologies (Not Devices)

The tool has **two entry types:**
1. **Devices** — specific machines (GentleMax Pro, Soprano ICE)
2. **Technologies** — methods/terms that need clarification

| Technology | Full Name | What It Is | Classification |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **SHR** | Super Hair Removal | Delivery method — can be laser OR IPL | ⚠️ Ask what device |
| **AFT** | Advanced Fluorescence Technology | Alma's advanced IPL technology | ❌ Not a laser |
| **BBL** | BroadBand Light | Sciton's brand name for IPL | ❌ Not a laser |
| **E-Light / ELOS** | Electro-Optical Synergy | IPL + RF combination | ❌ Not a laser |
| **OPT** | Optimal Pulse Technology | IPL variant | ❌ Not a laser |
| **DPL** | Dynamic Pulse Light | IPL variant | ❌ Not a laser |

**Display for technology searches:**

When someone searches "SHR":
> "SHR (Super Hair Removal) is a **delivery method**, not a device. It can be applied to BOTH real lasers AND IPL machines.
>
> Ask your clinic: **What device do you use for SHR?**
> - Soprano, MeDioStar → ✅ Real laser
> - Harmony XL Pro IPL applicator → ❌ Not a laser
>
> The technology name alone doesn't tell you if it's a real laser."

When someone searches "AFT":
> "AFT (Advanced Fluorescence Technology) is Alma's **advanced IPL technology** — it is NOT a laser.
>
> AFT uses a fluorescence filter to improve IPL efficiency, but it's still broad-spectrum light, not a focused laser beam. Studies show IPL achieves ~27% long-term reduction vs ~46% for Alexandrite lasers.
>
> Find clinics using real laser technology →"

### 5.8 SHR Device Examples

| Device | SHR Mode? | Underlying Technology | Classification |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| Soprano Titanium | Yes | Diode laser | ✅ Real laser |
| Soprano ICE | Yes | Diode laser | ✅ Real laser |
| MeDioStar | Yes | Diode laser | ✅ Real laser |
| Harmony XL Pro (SHR applicator) | Yes | IPL | ❌ Still IPL |
| Alma REJUVE | Yes | IPL | ❌ Still IPL |

**Rule:** If a clinic says "we use SHR" — ask WHAT device. SHR on a Soprano = real laser. SHR on an IPL applicator = still IPL.

### 9.2 Phased Build Strategy

**Key insight:** Clinical real lasers are far fewer than consumer IPL devices. Prioritize what matters for the directory use case.

| Category | Count | Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Clinical real lasers | ~25 | 🥇 Phase 1 | What clinics actually use |
| Home real lasers | 2 | 🥇 Phase 1 | Easy win (Tria only) |
| Technologies (SHR, AFT, BBL, etc.) | ~6 | 🥇 Phase 1 | Common confusion points |
| Multi-purpose platforms | ~5 | 🥇 Phase 1 | Important to flag |
| Professional IPL devices | ~15 | 🥈 Phase 2 | "Is this a laser?" questions |
| Consumer IPL (by brand) | ~12 brands | 🥉 Phase 3 | Less relevant to directory |

**Phase 1 (Launch): ~38 entries**
- All Candela devices (GentleMax Pro, GentleLase, GentleYAG, etc.)
- All Lumenis lasers (LightSheer Duet/Quattro, Splendor X)
- All Cynosure lasers (Elite iQ, Apogee, Vectus)
- All Alma lasers (Soprano Titanium/ICE/Platinum)
- Lutronic Clarity II
- InMode DiolazeXL
- DEKA Motus AX
- Asclepion MeDioStar
- Tria 4X and Tria Precision
- Technologies: SHR, AFT, BBL, E-Light/ELOS, OPT, DPL
- Multi-purpose platforms: Harmony XL Pro, Nordlys, Icon, Stellar M22

**Phase 2: Professional IPL (~15 entries)**
- Sciton Forever Bare BBL, BBL Hero
- Lumenis M22 IPL, Quantum
- InMode Lumecca
- Venus Versa
- Other professional IPL devices

**Phase 3: Consumer IPL (by brand, not model)**
- Group by brand: "All Braun Silk Expert devices = IPL"
- "All Philips Lumea devices = IPL"
- Don't need every model — brand-level is enough
- These users aren't looking for clinics anyway

### 9.3 Entry Types

The database has two entry types:

```typescript
type EntryType = 'device' | 'technology';

interface DeviceEntry {
  type: 'device';
  name: string;           // "GentleMax Pro"
  manufacturer: string;   // "Candela"
  // ... full device schema
}

interface TechnologyEntry {
  type: 'technology';
  name: string;           // "SHR"
  fullName: string;       // "Super Hair Removal"
  description: string;    // What it is
  classification: 'ask_device' | 'not_laser';
  clarificationText: string;  // Display text explaining the technology
}
```

### 9.4 Expansion Strategy

Expand based on:
- User submissions ("machine not found")
- New products launched
- Search query data (what are people looking for?)
- "Not found" searches → prioritize adding those entries

---

## 10. Technical Implementation

### 10.1 Search Functionality

- Fuzzy matching (handle typos: "Gentlemax" → "GentleMax Pro")
- Partial matching ("Soprano" shows all Soprano variants)
- Manufacturer search ("Candela" shows all Candela machines)
- Autocomplete suggestions as user types

### 10.2 SEO Setup

- Main tool page: `/is-it-a-real-laser`
- Individual machine pages: `/is-it-a-real-laser/[slug]`
- Schema markup: FAQPage, Product (for machines)
- Internal linking to directory city pages

### 10.3 Analytics Tracking

Track:
- Search queries (what machines are people looking up?)
- "Not found" queries (what should we add?)
- Click-through to directory (conversion)
- Referral sources (where are backlinks coming from?)

## 12. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 6) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Indexed pages | 20+ | 50+ |
| Organic traffic to tool | 100/month | 1,000/month |
| Backlinks acquired | 5 | 50 |
| Click-through to directory | 10% | 15% |
| "Not found" submissions | Track | Reduce by adding machines |
| Referring domains | 3 | 20 |

## 13. Competitive Moat

**What competitors CAN replicate:**
- Scrape Google Maps, spin up directory pages
- Copy the concept of an equipment checker

**What competitors CANNOT easily replicate:**
- Deep domain expertise (SHR confusion, AFT distinction, BBL classification, multi-purpose dirty trick)
- Three-layer classification system
- Established backlinks pointing to the tool
- Reddit AMA insights and real consumer research
- Understanding that Forever Bare BBL isn't a laser even at a dermatologist
- Ongoing database maintenance and expansion

The moat isn't the tool itself — it's the knowledge encoded in the classifications and the backlink authority accumulated over time.
